"""
FIN41360 Assignment 1 helper package.

This package contains reusable utilities for:
- Downloading and processing Fama–French data needed for the assignment
- Loading clean monthly return series for industries and factors

All code is written in pure Python (NumPy/Pandas/SciPy ecosystem),
with a focus on modularity and clear documentation.

EXPLAIN: Keeping assignment-specific utilities in a small package
avoids polluting the root directory and makes reuse easier later.
